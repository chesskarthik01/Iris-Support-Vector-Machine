# Iris-Support-Vector-Machine
Using sci-kit learn, create a SVM classifier model to classify species from the iris dataset.
<br> Using Gridsearch, we can also improve our SVM model by refitting it to better parameters.
<br> The gridsearch makes the notebook appear very strangely, so to view the full file with the end classification report and confusion matrix, open the file externally using nbviewer.
